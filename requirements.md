Key Components Specifications
Main Process (main.ts)
typescript
// Core responsibilities:
- Window management (transparent, always-on-top)
- Global shortcut registration
- IPC handlers for renderer communication
- Security context isolation
- Auto-updater integration
Trust Verification System
typescript
interface TrustData {
  imageMatches: ImageMatch[];
  mutualConnections: Connection[];
  socialProfiles: SocialProfile[];
  trustScore: number;
  verificationStatus: 'verified' | 'suspicious' | 'unknown';
}
Activity Matching Engine
typescript
interface ActivitySuggestion {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  type: 'event' | 'restaurant' | 'activity';
  location: Location;
  matchScore: number;
  sharedInterests: string[];
  inviteTemplate: string;
}
NLP Processing
typescript
interface ChatAnalysis {
  extractedInterests: string[];
  topics: string[];
  sentiment: 'positive' | 'neutral' | 'negative';
  suggestedActivities: ActivitySuggestion[];
}
API Integrations
Required APIs
Reverse Image Search: TinEye, Google Images, Bing

Social Platforms: Facebook Graph, LinkedIn, Instagram (limited)

Events/Activities: Eventbrite, Meetup, Google Places, Yelp

NLP Services: OpenAI GPT-4o (optional), local Ollama

Geolocation: Browser Geolocation API, IP-based services

Rate Limiting Strategy
Implement exponential backoff

Cache responses for 24 hours

User-configurable API call limits

Graceful degradation when limits exceeded

Privacy & Security Requirements
Data Handling
Local-first processing by default

Explicit consent for cloud services

Encrypted local storage for sensitive data

No persistent user tracking

Clear data retention policies

Security Measures
Context isolation between main and renderer

Secure IPC communication

API key encryption

Regular security audits

Content Security Policy implementation
